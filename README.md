This is how this web app works:

1. Using the Web Speech APIâ€™s `SpeechRecognition` interface to listen your voice from a microphone
2. Send your message to [Dialogflow][formerly known as api.ai](https://dialogflow) (the natural language processing platform) as a text string
3. Once the AI from the Dialogflow returns the reply text back, use the `SpeechSynthesis` interface to give it a synthetic voice.

### Setup
First go to google cloud console create a project enable the project to access the dialogflow api in the api/services and the create you key (credentials) they will be automatically saved to your local system.Send the file to your workspace and enjoy.


### Try It on Your Own Server

Rename the `.env.local` to `.env` and fill the env vars:

```
PROJECT_ID //the project Id of the project you gave access to the dialogflow api
```
.
